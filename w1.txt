You have taken the lead on this project which currently has the highest priority on our 
backlog. On one of the other apps you maintain, the product owner has contacted you 
personally and asked you to create some new features as well as fix a bug. 
You feel you cannot complete all of this work in a reasonable amount of time. 
How would you handle this situation?


Answer:
I will thoroughly analyze the scope of the requested features and the high-priority project.
After the analysis, I will discuss the potential impact on project timelines or the need 
for additional resources with the PO. I will suggest alternatives such as extending 
deadlines or deferring new features. Through collaboration with the PO, we should be able 
to find a compromise that balances the needs of both projects.
